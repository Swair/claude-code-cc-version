## Abstract

This paper establishes a theoretical framework for proactive interactive agents.

**Borrowed Frameworks**: Uses emergence theory (Anderson, 1972) and abstraction levels (Brooks, 1995) as meta-theoretical stance and analytical framework.

**Original Contributions**:
1. Formal definitions of core concepts: proactive interaction, event, absence
2. Discovery and proof of **Absence Detection Theorem** (absence must rely on time)
3. Discovery and proof of **Triple Dilemma** (autonomy, low overhead, real-time cannot be simultaneously satisfied)
4. Framework for mapping structural constraints to architectural design

**Theoretical Position**: Borrows mature philosophical frameworks as analytical tools to derive original insights in the field of proactive interaction.

## Chapter 1: Meta-Principles - Theoretical Stance

### 1.1 Reductionism vs. Emergence (Borrowed)

**Reductionism**: Higher-level phenomena can be reduced to lower-level elements.

**Emergence**: Higher-level concepts have independent validity and cannot be simply reduced to lower levels (Anderson, 1972).

**This Theory's Stance**: Adopts emergence theory.

```
Applications:
- Proactivity holds at user layer, not negated by lower-level implementation
- Analogy: Concurrency holds at application layer, not negated by serial execution at bottom
- Analogy: Temperature holds at macro layer, not negated by molecular kinetics at bottom
```

---

### 1.2 Abstraction Levels Analytical Framework (Borrowed)

**Level Spectrum**:
```
User Layer (Experience) → Application Layer (Logic) → System Layer (Implementation) → Hardware Layer (Physical)
```

**This Theory's Analytical Method**:
- Define proactive interaction at user layer
- Analyze constraints at implementation layer
- Do not confuse judgments across layers

---

### 1.3 Methodological Rules

**Rule 1**: Before judging any conclusion, first clarify at which layer the judgment is made.

**Rule 2**: Architectural design is choosing appropriate abstraction level to solve problems, not reducing to the bottom.

**Rule 3**: Upper-layer definitions guide lower-layer design; lower-layer implementation does not negate upper-layer concepts.

---

## Chapter 2: Definitions - Formalization of Proactive Interaction

### 2.1 Definition of Interaction

**Definition 1** (Interaction): Information exchange process between system and user. Formalized as sequence:
```
S = {(u₁, r₁), (u₂, r₂), ..., (uₙ, rₙ)}
```
where uᵢ ∈ U (user input), rᵢ ∈ R (system response).

---

### 2.2 Definition of Proactive Interaction

**Definition 2** (Proactive Interaction): There exists rᵢ ∈ R such that uᵢ = ∅ (user did not issue command).

**Definition 3** (Passive Interaction): ∀rᵢ ∈ R, there exists uᵢ ∈ U such that rᵢ is a response to uᵢ.

---

### 2.3 Exclusion of Incorrect Definitions

**Proposition 1**: "Trigger script is written by user, therefore not proactive" is an incorrect definition.

**Proof** (by contradiction):
```
Assumption: Trigger is written by user → not proactive
Analogy: Alarm clock is set by user → alarm ringing is not proactive reminder

Contradiction:
- When alarm rings, user did not issue "report time" command
- By Definition 2, alarm ringing is proactive interaction

∴ Assumption is false
```

**Judgment Standard**: If the initiator of interaction is the system, proactive interaction definition is satisfied.

---

### 2.4 Necessary Conditions for Proactive Interaction

**Proposition 2**: Proactive interaction requires three core capabilities, none can be missing.

```
Perception: Acquire external state information
    ↓
Decision: Decide whether to trigger interaction
    ↓
Response: Execute interaction with user
```

**Proof of Necessity**:
- Without perception → no basis for triggering
- Without decision → random triggering or no triggering
- Without response → proactive interaction does not hold

---

## Chapter 3: Core Concepts: Perception, Decision, Response

### 3.1 Perception

**Definition 4** (Perception): System's capability to acquire external state information.

**Perception Object Classification**:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| User State | User active/idle/focused | last_interaction_time |
| System State | CPU/memory/disk | cpu_temperature = 85°C |
| Task State | Complete/fail/progress | download.progress = 100% |
| Environment State | Time/location/network | current_time = 14:30 |

---

### 3.2 Decision

**Definition 5** (Decision): System's capability to decide whether to trigger interaction based on perception results.

**Formalization**:
```
F(state, config) → {true, false}
```

---

### 3.3 Response

**Definition 6** (Response): System's capability to interact with user after triggering.

**Response Types**:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Conversational | LLM generates reply | "CPU temperature too high, take care" |
| Task-oriented | Execute task then notify | "Cleaned 5 processes" |
| Silent | Execute in background without notification | Log rotation complete |

---

## Chapter 4: Key Concepts: Event and Absence

### 4.1 Event

**Definition 7** (Event): State change that occurs at a specific point in time and can be captured by the system.

**Formalization**: e = (type, timestamp, payload)

**Characteristics**:
- Has clear occurrence time point
- Can be listened, captured, callback
- Is positive concept (something happens)

---

### 4.2 Absence

**Definition 8** (Absence): State where expected event does not occur within specified time.

**Formalization**:
```
Let event set E = {e₁, e₂, ..., eₙ}
Let last_event_time = max{t(eᵢ) | eᵢ has occurred}

Absence holds ⇔ current_time - last_event_time > threshold
```

**Characteristics**:
- No clear occurrence time point
- Cannot be directly listened
- Is negative concept (something does not happen)
- Detection must rely on time reference

---

### 4.3 Absence Detection Theorem (Original)

**Theorem 1** (Absence Detection Theorem): Detecting absence must rely on time reference; cannot be achieved by pure event-driven approach.

**Proof**:
```
Premise 1: Event-driven requires events to listen to
Premise 2: Absence = no event occurs
Premise 3: "No event" is not an event

Inference:
- Absence cannot produce interrupt/callback/signal
- ∴ Absence cannot be detected by event-driven

Detection method:
- Record last_event_time
- Continuously compute current_time - last_event_time
- If difference > threshold → absence holds

∴ Absence detection must rely on time reference
```

**Engineering Implication**: User idle detection, sedentary reminder, and other absence scenarios cannot be achieved by pure event-driven approach.

---

## Chapter 5: Structural Constraints: Triple Dilemma (Original)

### 5.1 Statement of Triple Dilemma

**Theorem 2** (Triple Dilemma): In proactive interaction perception, the following three objectives cannot be simultaneously satisfied:

| Vertex | Definition | Ideal State |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Autonomy** | System autonomously decides what to perceive | Perceive whatever it wants |
| **Low Overhead** | Minimum resource consumption, no idle spinning | CPU 0%, reasoning cost 0 |
| **Real-time** | State changes perceived immediately | Zero latency |

---

### 5.2 Proof of Triple Dilemma

**Proof** (by case analysis):

**Case 1: Autonomy + Low Overhead**
```
Approach: Periodic polling
- Can perceive arbitrary state (Autonomy ✓)
- Longer period → lower overhead (Low Overhead ✓)
- But longer period → higher latency (Real-time ✗)
∴ Sacrifice real-time
```

**Case 2: Low Overhead + Real-time**
```
Approach: Event-driven
- Event perceived immediately (Real-time ✓)
- No idle spinning when no event (Low Overhead ✓)
- But can only perceive states with event sources (Autonomy ✗)
∴ Sacrifice autonomy
```

**Case 3: Autonomy + Real-time**
```
Approach: Continuous monitoring + multi-threaded polling
- Can perceive arbitrary state (Autonomy ✓)
- State changes perceived immediately (Real-time ✓)
- But continuously occupies resources (Low Overhead ✗)
∴ Sacrifice low overhead
```

**∴ Any two can be satisfied simultaneously, the third must be sacrificed.**

---

## Chapter 6: Architectural Decision: Triple Convergence (Original)

### 6.1 Triple Convergence Argument

**Proposition 3**: Abandoning autonomy is a joint requirement of engineering feasibility, user trust, and system security.

| Dimension | Argument | Conclusion |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Engineering Constraints** | Triple dilemma proves three cannot coexist | Must abandon one vertex |
| **Trust Requirement** | User needs to know what system perceives | Perception logic must be transparent |
| **Security Requirement** | System can only perceive authorized content | Perception boundary must be explicitly declared |

**∴ Triple convergence to same decision: Abandon autonomy, perception goals explicitly defined by humans.**

---

### 6.2 Deep Meaning of Abandoning Autonomy

**Proposition 4**: Abandoning autonomy is not engineering compromise, but foundation of trust model.

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Abandoning autonomy = capability degradation" | ❌ Wrong — it's the foundation of trust model |
| "Can be restored when technology matures" | ⚠️ Partially correct — can evolve, but current is optimal |
| "Do users really care?" | ✅ Empirical — privacy compliance requires explicit authorization |

---

## Chapter 7: From Constraints to Design: Mapping Framework (Original)

### 7.1 Constraint→Decision Mapping Table

| Constraint | Design Response | Implementation Mechanism |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Perception goals must be predefined | Pluginization | `active/plugin/trigger` explicit declaration |
| Absence detection relies on time | Layered implementation | threshold (countdown) + interval (periodic) |
| Abandon autonomy for low overhead + real-time | trigger script lightweight judgment | 100ms timeout, non-LLM |
| Different scenarios, different tradeoffs | Multi-mode triggering | periodic / idle / idle_once |

---

### 7.2 Formalization of Pluginization

**Definition 9** (Plugin): Basic unit of proactive interaction, formalized as triple:
```
Plugin = (T, C, A)

Where:
T: trigger script, T: State → {true, false}
C: trigger mode configuration, C ∈ {periodic, idle, idle_once}
A: interaction configuration, A → Prompt
```

**Proposition 5**: Pluginization transforms "perception must be predefined" into explicit architectural contract.

**Contract Content**:
1. **Controllable**: User knows what each plugin perceives
2. **Auditable**: Each plugin's trigger script is readable and reviewable
3. **Shareable**: Plugins can be distributed, reused, iterated in community

---

## Chapter 8: Classification of Trigger Modes (Inductive Observation)

### 8.1 Two-Way Classification of Trigger Sources

**Observation 1**: Trigger sources of proactive interaction can be inductively classified into two categories.

| Source | Detection Method | Corresponding Mode | Example |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|---------|
| Time elapsing | Timer | periodic | Check CPU every 60 seconds |
| Activity absence | Time difference calculation | idle / idle_once | User no input for 5 minutes |

**Note**: 
- Core modes: **periodic + idle**
- idle_once is a parameterized variant of idle (controlled by triggered_count)

---

### 8.2 Why Choose These Two Core Modes?

**Engineering Considerations**:
- **periodic**: Covers states without event sources (CPU temperature, etc.) — relies on time elapsing
- **idle**: Covers user idle scenarios (absence detection, Theorem 1) — relies on time difference calculation
- **idle_once**: Variant of idle, controlled by triggered_count for single-trigger

**Note**:
- Core modes: **periodic + idle**
- idle_once is a variant of idle, not independent mode

---

### 8.3 Extensibility Notes

| Extension Type | Description | Example |
|----------------|-------------|---------|
| Intra-mode extension | New plugin instances | cpu_monitor → memory_monitor |
| Parameter extension | Adjust interval/threshold | 60s → 300s |
| Logic extension | Modify trigger script | Temperature threshold 85°C → 90°C |

---

## Chapter 9: User Layer Verification

### 9.1 Consistency Verification

| Layer | Description | Consistent? |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **User Layer** | User did not issue command → received response | ✅ Proactive interaction holds (Definition 2) |
| **Implementation Layer** | Polling, predefined, LLM passively called | ✅ Constraints satisfied (Theorem 1, 2) |
| **Mapping Relation** | Implementation constraints don't negate user layer definition | ✅ Meta-principle satisfied (Chapter 1) |

---

### 9.2 Emergence of Proactivity

**Proposition 6**: Proactivity is a user-layer emergent concept; there is no "proactivity" concept at implementation layer.

**Proof**:
```
Implementation layer only has:
- Timer triggering
- Script execution
- Callback invocation

User layer emerges:
- "System proactively notified me"
- "Agent anticipated my needs"
- "Intelligent assistant"

∴ Proactivity is a user-layer emergent concept (Chapter 1 Meta-Principle)
```
